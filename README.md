⚠️ Due to the heavy usage of KV and Workers quotas on Cloudflare free plan, the paid Cloudflare Worker Plan is recommended for this remediation component.

⚠️ Follow this guide to [test on free Plan](https://doc.crowdsec.net/u/bouncers/cloudflare-workers/#appendix-test-with-cloudflare-free-plan)

⚠️ Make sure to properly set up [The worker route fail mode](https://doc.crowdsec.net/u/bouncers/cloudflare-workers#setting-up-the-worker-route-fail-mode)

# CrowdSec Cloudflare Worker 

A remediation component for Cloudflare.

## How does it work

This remediation component deploys Cloudflare Worker in front of a Cloudflare Zone/Website, which checks if incoming IP addresses are present in a KV store and takes necessary remedial actions. It also periodically updates the KV store with CrowdSec LAPI's decisions.

# Documentation

Please follow the [official documentation](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/bouncers/cloudflare-workers).
